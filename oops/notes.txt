oops is a methadology to design a program using classes and objects
for scalability

1. data abstraction - In C++, data abstraction means designing classes in such a way that:
The user of the class doesn’t need to know how it works internally.
They only need to know what it does.
advanyagrs -secure and better user experience

2. data encapsulation  encapsulation means:
Keeping data private or protected.
Providing public methods (getters/setters) to access or modify that data safely.

3. inheritance-Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child/derived class) acquires the properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) of another class (parent/base class).
✅ Why Use Inheritance?
Code reuse – you don’t need to write the same code again.
Hierarchical classification – "is-a" relationships.
Makes programs easier to maintain and scale.
4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms." same code diff fn/work
It allows one function, method, or operator to behave differently based on the context.


classes are user-defined datatype

access modifiers
private public protected
